# Computational Complexity of Generalized Syndrome Decoding Problem
In this project, we analyze the complexity of the classical and quantum information set decoding algorithms used to solve the generalized version of the syndrome decoding problem. For more details, refer to https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12810.

## Requirements

Before building the project, one needs to have installed the following:  
1. [**Boost**](https://www.boost.org/users/download/) set of libraries;
