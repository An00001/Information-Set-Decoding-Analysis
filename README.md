# Computational-Complexity-of-Generalized-Syndrome-Decoding-Problem
In this project, we analyze the complexity of the classical and quantum information set decoding algorithms that are used to solve the generalized version of the syndrome decoding problem using. For more details, refer to https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12810.
